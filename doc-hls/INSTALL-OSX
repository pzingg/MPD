Getting MPD to build on OS X 10.8.
Notes by Peter Zingg, https://github/pzingg

Install Xcode 4.4

Launch Xcode. In Preferences > Downloads, Install Command line tools.

Install homebrew or other OS X package manager.

Install the required GLib library and additional encoder and decoder 
libraries as described in INSTALL:
brew install glib
brew install libid3tag
brew install mad
brew install faad2
brew install libao

Download GNU compiler from HPC on OS X at Sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hpc/

Install GNU compiler and standard libraries:
sudo tar xvzf gcc-mlion.tar.gz -C /

NOTE: I think a new GNU compiler can also be installed via homebrew.

Hack configure.ac to find GNU standard libraries that gcc-mlion.tar.gz 
installs.  FIXME: The following change is a bad hack.  Autoconf should
be able to find the standard libraries on Darwin, either with the 
Apple-supplied Clang-based compilers, or with the official GNU compilers.
Probably need to do a check for these in various standard install
locations, but I'm not an autoconf expert.
